# Your strength as a young person
### March 26th, 2024
When you're young, you severely underestimate yourself. In reality you are strong in vital ways.

**1. Coachability**\
You can learn fast and pick up new skills. Veterans are set in old ways. Be a sponge, devour knowledge, ask questions.

**2. Network**\
All your friends are smart college kids, soon-to-be grads. This is a ripe talent pool for hire. Work together on projects, make intros for companies.

**3. Risk tolerance**\
You have nothing to lose, so youâ€™re able to drop everything to work on exciting high-potential projects & companies. Take a gap year, join a lab, hustle your way onto a team.

Go out and prove yourself. You've got this.
