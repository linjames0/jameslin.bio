                <p>
                    When you're young, you severely underestimate yourself. In reality you are strong in vital ways.

                    <b>1. Coachability</b>
                    <br />
                    You can learn fast and pick up new skills. Veterans are set in old ways. Be a sponge, devour knowledge, ask questions.
                </p>

                    <b>2. Network</b>
                    <br />
                    All your friends are smart college kids, soon-to-be grads. This is a ripe talent pool for hire. Work together on projects, make intros for companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. Risk tolerance</b>
                    <br />
                    You have nothing to lose, so youâ€™re able to drop everything to work on exciting high-potential projects & companies. Take a gap year, join a lab, hustle your way onto a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go out and prove yourself. You've got this.
