What falling in love feels like.

...

Two years after my last serious relationship, I've found someone who makes me want to try again.

I say 'I found', but maybe it's more accurate to say I was found by her. She's the first person who sees me so completely, gets things the way I do, appreciates books and art and experiences the way I do.

She picks up on all my wordplay and word choice, mannerisms, and sometimes it feels like she knows me better than I do.


I feel comfortable sharing space and silence with her.
