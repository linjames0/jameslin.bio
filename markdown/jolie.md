What falling in love feels like.

...

Two years after my last serious relationship, I've found someone who makes me want to try again.

I say 'I found', but maybe it's more accurate to say I was found by her. She's the first person who sees me so completely, gets things the way I do, appreciates books and art and experiences the way I do. She picks up on all my wordplay and word choice, mannerisms, and sometimes it feels like she knows me better than I do.

I had just landed in a new city, about to start a year-long research position when we stumbled into each other. We had mutual friends. Many, actually. Almost a quarter of everyone I knew she knew, she had studied in Toronto where I was from, and we both had stints in SF and Boston. Yet somehow we never crossed paths until that day—something she likes to bring up often; fate, it must be.

The first time we really talked, we spent hours exchanging life stories, favorite movies and books, people we both admired. We went on about our mutual pilgrimages, mine a walk across Japan, hers a hike up to Poland from Berlin. We riffed off quotes, agreed on school being lame, and ended up both stumbling on slanted sidewalks.

Years of wandering, secure in myself but not quite sure of another, and all at once it felt like I had rediscovered a friend from a past life.

And that's how it was for the first 3 months—friends.

...

Well, close friends (she would say best friends). Over the course of the semester, I got to know her better through H Mart grocery runs, cooking sessions, and late night convos over cantonese egg tarts.

She had many particularities when it came to food. Chicken had to be cooked a specific way, plates had to be pre-heated, eggs had to be cooked in fours and not eights. This was frustrating to accommodate at the start, but over time I came to see that there was a reason for every detail. She'd fight bitterly for cooking something her way because, while the specifics glazed over in my mind, to her, the details were essential ingredients for quality. And quality matters to her because, more than anyone I know, she cares deeply about the experiences she serves herself and others. It's one of the many things I love about her.

During our friendship, I got to see different sides of her in context. She can be demanding at times, and come across brisk, but I have never had to doubt her intentions. She is frank to a fault but always means well. She is more whimsical than I expected, and can match my humor with an equal dose of silliness. But she also knows when to slow down and let silence fill in the gaps. There's no expectation to talk nonstop; it's comfortable just sharing space.

When we first started dating, our dynamic didn't feel all that different apart from the newfound intimacy. It felt like we'd already been going out for months. We could read the other's mind and communicate in glances. We already knew the good and the bad about each other, and with that in mind we still chose to commit. 

I think the friends -> lovers pipeline works because you already know you like each other. You're not putting up a front trying to impress a girl. You don't need to lie or flex or gloss over details. You can just be yourself. That's who she likes.

But being yourself doesn't mean you stay that way either. When I'm around her, she brings out *more* of me: my funniest and my wittiest, my kindest and most considerate. When I see how badass she is, I want to work harder. When I see how thoughtful she is, I'm inspired to be a better friend. She makes me want to learn and change for the better.

And it goes both ways. Just as I'm constantly growing as a person, so is she. She almost never changes her mind in the moment, but give her a day or two and she'll have marinated privately on what you've said. She can be stubborn but she is fair. Of all our dynamics, this is the one that I think will get us to year forty. There's a mutual respect and effort to grow. Love is a two-way street and it really feels that way with her. 

Very quickly, she became the first person on my mind when I came across a song or quote that I wanted to share. If I watched a movie or thought of a terrible pun, she'd be the first to hear. If I felt stressed about work, I could count on having a hot meal or egg tarts waiting for me at home delivered by hand. When I went through a rough family situation, she was there, patient and sturdy as the ground.

There's a word in Hebrew, להכיל (lehakil), which means 'to contain' or 'to hold', not just physically but also emotionally and mentally. It's used in the sense of holding space for someone, to accept and to embrace all parts of them, as they are.

She contains me. And I contain her. There's nothing we can't talk about, relate on, discuss, joke about, no words too sacred that they can't be held in the space between the two of us. And that's what falling in love is like. Real love. Finding someone who can contain your everything, and still have space left over for when you grow. I'm the most creative with words when I'm with her because I know she'll get it. I can omit a few sentences when we're talking because she can read paragraphs in my glances. The things I love most about myself she sees and loves too. We are witness to one another, in all of our individual entireties.

I know it's still early. The last time I fell so fast for someone I was cut by their obsidian apathy and it hurt. I've seen love sour and honeymoons wane, and there's so much I don't know about her. But she makes me want to try again. Not tentatively, but with conviction and courage.

To find someone worth fighting for is a beautiful thing.
