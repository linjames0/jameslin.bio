I spent the past month in the [Boyden Lab](https://synthneuro.org/) at MIT. The lab is run by [Ed](https://synthneuro.org/people/ed-boyden/) and has a history of inventing scientific tools, including but not limited to: [optogenetics](<https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1525)>), [temporal interference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5520675/), [expansion microscopy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0219-4), and [temporal multiplexed imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423012278). Any of these tools on their own could make an argument for a Nobel — to have discovered and developed several is indicative of a systematic process, a sound approach to producing great science.

Apart from academic achievements, the lab has a history of spinning out companies working on [precision neuroimaging](https://e11.bio/), [AI for science](https://www.futurehouse.org/), and [wearable neurotechnologies](https://elemindtech.com/) to name a few. Here, there is a deep understanding of what institutions are appropriate for the progress we hope to achieve.

I’m working on [nanoscale-imaging of C. elegans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35320565/) and in a future post I’ll do a deeper dive into my research. This post, however, is my attempt to distill observations on the *process* of doing great science from inside a world-class lab. This is not a guide to the 'publish or perish' flavor of science. I'm interested in how paradigms get torn down and rebuilt through the scientific method. There's magic here and it's working.

## How we get things done
It's worth noting that the Boyden Lab is atypical in some important ways:

#### 1. Flat hierarchy
Size does matter when you're running a 50-person lab. Most labs this large tend to bureaucratize but Ed has normalized a different kind of structure:

* Researchers have full agency over their own projects
* Anyone can email him directly anytime
* Ed does monthly 1-on-1s with every single lab member

Through this flat structure, he facilitates highly efficient top-down decision-making and kills seniority politics. You don't need to go through a chain of authority to reach him. Even undergrads can propose and run their own experiments if the ideas are good. It's a highly merit-based culture.

On the other hand, because everyone is working on their own thing, it can sometimes feel like people are all moving in different directions instead of toward a single concerted goal. Some of the best work in the lab is collaborative, which can be harder to enforce when people by default work independently.

#### 2. Extreme diversity of ideas
Though the main focus of the lab is neuroscience, we have lab members working on engineering synthetic cells, sulfur-capturing microbes, implosion fabrication, expansion of cell culture, brain simulations, spatial transcriptomics, optogenetics drug delivery, biological foundation models, and on and on.

Because there are so many flavors of science in a single place, I've gotten to sample dozens of different approaches to research and observe other fields, which has led to unlikely collaborations with people in seemingly unrelated areas. Talking with postdocs specializing in material science and EM chemistry helped me refine concrete ideas for expanding worms. I realized that a big part of research is finding great ideas from all corners of science and putting them together, which is facilitated by a diverse research group.

#### 3. Go for gold
The lab culture is a severe rejection of incrementalism. We want to innovate and redefine, not optimize p-values or benchmarks.

Ed frequently questions the ambition of an idea: is it scalable? can we open-source the method for all labs? how does this fundamentally change how science gets done? He also constantly pushes for us to invert the premise: what if we didn't try to increase microscope resolution? what if instead [we made our samples bigger](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0219-4)? Most of the time when you invert you arrive at something that sounds ridiculous, but on those rare occasions where the conclusion gives you a pause, you're on the cusp of revolution.

What struck me the most is that people (supposedly risk-averse academics!) join with the understanding they might not get *any papers* during their time at the lab. Many experiments fail and in big ways, but these are table stakes for great science. Some of our experiments end up working and they change the game.

---

It's hard to overstate how important these cultural pillars are for facilitating risk-taking and innovation. It's equally important to note just how out-of-place this culture is in academia. Risk-taking is not the norm. Most labs are beholden to foreseeable, reliable results to secure grants and further funding. The kind of science that results from incremental thinking is fundamentally uninteresting. It is necessary, yes, but in my view the best kind of science is aspirational with a chance of huge if true.

With that out of the way, a lot of things remain true across different research labs.

## What to know about research
Or: advice on how to make the most of your time in lab.

#### 1. You get what you put in
* People are too busy to chase you
* Get to know everyone in the lab
    * Get context on what people are working on
    * People have already ran into the same problems and have thought about solutions
    * This also opens doors for potential collaborations - there may be synergies
* Meetings aren't (totally) useless
    * Show up with something to contribute
    * The point is to build familiarity, reputation, and context
* Shadow people
    * When you’re new, it's important to just get your hands dirty and learn how to do grunt work
    * Wet lab is rampant with tacit knowledge and you learn best by watching people actually run the experiments and then doing them yourself
    * In my first month I shadowed 6 postdocs, mostly to fill in for when my supervising postdoc was busy
        * I picked up wet lab skills and learned where various equipment was stationed
        * I also got a sense for the different ways people do things and their reasoning e.g. how strict each person was with cleanliness, when to use plastic vs glass pipettes, when to use normal vs hydrophobic plates, how much light exposure a given sample could afford, etc.
* Exceed expectations
    * For my first check-in with Ed, I prepared slides on how I was doing the equivalent of a fairly smart MIT grad student, and quickly realized that the bar was much higher than just that. Complacency is not always bad but it is always a choice.
    
#### 2. Learning rate = feedback rate
* The single-most important factor for choosing a lab is the quality of mentorship
    * Everything else is secondary to ensuring you have a great supervisor or PI
    * Vet them before you join
        * Ask them questions, watch how they explain hard concepts, gauge their openness to new ideas, shadow them if possible
    * My supervisor is the reason I chose the lab
        * After shadowing him for a few weeks, I realized that he could consistently explain down to Level 5 where most stop at Level 2
* Ask, ask, ask
    * The best researchers in the lab are the ones who are asking the most questions
    * Keep asking questions until you can deliver a killer lecture on the topic
    * In a lab, the people around you likely are the top 1% in terms of knowledge about their specific topics
        * Halting your line of questioning on Level 1 or 2 when you have *the* experts on the topic is a disservice to yourself
* Learn to learn from all criticism
    * Focus on content and not delivery
        * Most people are bad at delivering feedback
    * There is always something to learn, even from harsh or blunt feedback
    * Make an effort to ask for feedback, even if uncomfortable
* Set up regular check-ins with your PI or postdoc
    * Your PI has the context on what everyone in the lab is doing, what other groups have tried, what approaches worked and what didn't etc.
    * You might have an impulse to come up with 'your own' ideas but you don't have to reinvent the wheel - there's likely an easier (and more elegant) solution to your problem already out there if you ask

#### 3. Focus
* **If you want to do great research, you cannot split your attention between projects**
    * I initially wanted to work on two projects over the course of a few months, but Ed convinced me to focus on just one (1) project for 6 months
    * The time it takes to understand every angle of a scientific challenge is significant, and the hardest problems are soluble only through [undivided effort](https://jameslin.bio/focus)
    * I was forced to internalize longer timelines rather than jumping around collecting low-hanging fruit
* Focus matters because attention to detail is critical
    * The only way to do great, novel research is by questioning and examining every premise
    * In science, every single detail of a protocol has a reason for being there. The reasoning might be strong, or it might be weak, and it's only through a deep understanding of every step that you can begin to interrogate and experiment with other conditions.
* Often, people take on new projects after they encounter a tough roadblock when in reality that's when they should focus more

#### 4. Relationships rule the world
* Collaborations come out of who you know
    * Go to seminars, sign up for presentations, email people you’d like to work with
* Surround yourself with people who inspire you through their brilliance
* One of the best ways to 'network' in academia is to show deep interest in people's research
    * Genuine curiosity is hard to fake
    * Nothing lights up a postdoc's eyes more reliably than asking questions about the details of their obscure research
    * Asking good questions is hard though - it's important to do your own research and show up with serious inquiries
    * Receiving poorly thought-out questions is a filter for people - nobody wants to waste their time on someone who clearly doesn't care that much

Beyond the research process, there were some surprising things about academic culture I got to see firsthand.

## Academic culture
A lot has already been written about the [failings of 'publish or perish' culture](https://jameshk.com/don-braben-scientific-freedom) so I won't go into detail on that. Instead, I want to make observations about the other forces that apply constant pressure across academia.

#### 1. Churn
Academia has a systemic talent problem. Most labs only have one professor-level person because the tenure system incentivizes great researchers to leave the lab to start their own group. Graduate students are only there for certification, and they leave for other positions after. Funding is low so research techs and undergrads jump at opportunities in industry for higher pay.

Because of the high level of churn, any given lab is often constrained by expertise. In industry, it's normal for people to stay at a single job for 10-20 years and in doing so they develop a deep domain expertise which is essential for hard technical breakthroughs. This is far more rare in academia, and you'll often be conversing with people who have only spent a few years on their current project or even field. As a result, your ability to learn quickly on your own is essential because the experts for your specific problem are either inaccessible or nonexistent.

#### 2. Competition
Given the rate of talent turnover, collaboration with other research groups becomes all the more important. But here, too, there are incentive problems. It can be hard to initiate collaborations with labs in the same field because of the competitive politics  of publishing. Often, both groups are trying to publish first on similar discoveries. This causes a major conflict in authorship: who gets first author? second author? how do you split credit? which lab gets the patent? etc.

This is less of a problem *within* labs. Because people in our group are all working on their own differentiated projects, there's far less politics and competition. There's an open spirit of collaboration - we frequently share reagents, data, assist with teaching new techniques, send papers, and make introductions.

#### 3. Education
I think what's often overlooked about researcher-types is that they are excellent at teaching. They have TA'd for classes, given lectures, described their work to family and relatives, and they write all the time (papers, grant proposals) explaining science to a general audience. Everyone is capable of explaining their research in depth, sometimes down to the atom but usually at least down to the level of cells. For people aspiring to be sponges, academic researchers are your ocean.

But I've also been surprised how little people know outside of their own domains of expertise. Even at MIT, you can quickly become one of the lab experts on a relevant but niche area. Chemists and neuroscientists absolutely school me in their lane, but I've realized that my depth in several areas (CS, biology, neuroscience, physics) means that I usually have something to contribute to specialists.

And it's been equally startling the extent to which people are resistant to learning about new fields. Even neuroscientists struggle sometimes with synaptic plasticity. However, there are some who constantly absorb knowledge regardless of domain and these people stand out in a crowded field.

#### 4. Funding
Two things can be true at once - there is a lot of funding in academia, and funding is a constant constraint. Most small labs operate on $500k a year and for the larger ones annual funding can be upwards of $5M.

On its own, this is a large sum. But when you factor in the researchers ($50k-100k / person), reagents ($100-50k / bottle), and scientific equipment (~$50k-1M / unit), funding gets depleted rapidly by recurring costs. A single experiment can run upwards of $100k and cost weeks to months of researcher time.

What this feels like on the ground is a confusing contradiction. Many researchers spend weeks writing grant proposals. But there's also a lot of wasteful behavior. Because we deal with wildly out of proportion numbers all the time from nano up to giga, there's an insensitivity towards dollar amounts. We take extra care when experiments cost $50k, but $1k just isn't very much in comparison.

Our lab is large and for the most part we have access to state of the art equipment and reagents. We're also much more careful about preventing waste and minimizing administrative bloat. But because of our size we incur greater overhead than most labs. 

Relevant to this point: earlier last year the BRAIN Initiative announced a [budget cut of nearly $300M](https://www.thetransmitter.org/funding/278-million-cut-in-brain-initiative-funding-leaves-neuroscientists-in-limbo/) for neuroscientific research, which was a major source of funding for neuroscience labs like ours. Along with the near-term risk of large cuts in government funding, money anxiety has been brought back to the forefront of academic concerns.

#### 5. Intensity
Having spent some years around SF startup founders, I was used to a high-intensity all-out-ness, something sorely missing from academic culture. I usually start lab-related stuff at 10am and I'm almost always the last to leave the lab around 10pm. In contrast, most people usually get in around noon and leave early evening. In part this is because some people work from home, but there are two other culprits: there's often no incentive for intensity and researchers tend to emphasize work-life balance.

In most startups, your company is constantly under competitive pressure and threats of running out of money. If you don't stay in the office until 1am, some other team will outcompete you and you will lose your job. There isn't time to take your time.

In academia, there are similar pressures if you’re working in highly competitive research areas (think CRISPR engineering in 2012-2013). But for most labs, the research is niche enough (stochastic GEVI functionalization for neurons in *C. elegans*) that the competitive pressures *don’t feel* front and center.

The other thing is that most PhDs and postdocs are in their late 20s and early 30s, many of them have families and lives outside of lab. They're at a stage in life where work isn't so all-consuming.

This is valid! Research isn't everything. I take some weekends off to make time for friends and road trips and personal interests. But the slower pace is something to keep in mind if you're thinking of doing research.

## A New Age
> Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in.\
\
— Alan Ada

Now, a question has surfaced and lingers on my mind: are academic labs the best place for science? The Boyden Lab is the best case for an academic lab but definitely not representative of most academic environments.

To start, there are many slower-paced, longer-term scientific ambitions which have historically only been possible in an academic setting. [The Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project) was a $3B effort to sequence the human genome with thin financial justification at the time, and yet a consortium of academic labs came together and made it happen. The scientific and medical communities have since reaped the benefits of cheap, ubiquitous, scalable sequencing.

Our lab is particularly concerned with mapping the human brain—referred to as the [Human Connectome Project](https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/human-connectome/connectome-programs)—and developing the key neurotechnologies that come out of that research. It's unclear what the financial incentives are for such a project, but it will undoubtedly have great consequences for our understanding of the most complex organ known to man. If you're interested in funding or supporting the effort in any way, shoot me an email @ [linjames@mit.edu](mailto:linjames@mit.edu). We're constantly looking to work with great scientists who can learn fast.

On the other side, [Focused Research Organizations](https://www.convergentresearch.org/) (cofounded by Boyden Lab alum) have taken the spotlight in recent years as experimental attempts to reshape how science gets done. It's not clear how these attempts will shake out but they seem to be moving us in the right direction.

In parallel, last year has brought along a wave of successes for new institutions of science. [The Arc Institute](https://arcinstitute.org/news/blog/evo) released an impressive biological foundation model called Evo. HuggingFace, arxiv, and private AI labs together facilitated extraordinary progress in machine learning. DeepMind shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their development and [open-sourcing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03708-4) of AlphaFold which has enabled the prediction of millions of protein structures. They have done so while achieving breakthrough results in solving complex math problems, chip design, sorting algorithms, energy efficiency, matrix operations, and competitive programming. I think they are the closest thing we have to a modern day [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs).

These are all examples of institutions outside of government and academia which have made an irrefutable case for their ability to do great science. Particularly, open-source approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in accelerating progress on scientific problems.

I'm not saying that there is no merit to academic labs—they are necessary to the scientific apparatus, and the incentives of academic labs create a fantastic learning environment to pick up skills and experience. What I *am* questioning is whether they are the best place for breakthrough research. More and more, I think not. Talent churns, funding is constrained, and research moves forward at a glacial pace. Perhaps it's time to reconsider how we go about uncovering nature's mysteries.
