I wish somebody had told me that you could sample different life experiences before committing. That by being aunthentic and curious you could peel back layers and layers of a person or topic in a brief span of time. That when it comes to mood and relationships and everything in between, the small things matter just as much as the big, sweeping, obvious things.

The small things sustain the big things in the same way a patch of soil supports a great redwood.

Note to self: when in doubt, start small.
