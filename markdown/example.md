# Attractive
### March 18th, 2024

Every so often, I come across people who I find attractive by virtue of their personality and character, people whose presence carries a magnetic weight. These are people I’d love to be friends with. The kinds of people who, secure in their own abilities, have the freedom to live life on their own terms.

Specifically, people who…
- don’t try to impress you
- are comfortable with silence
- are decisive and self-assured
- perform small acts of kindness but don’t seek credit
- tell you like it is
- have passion for a craft
- listen and observe, noticers of small details
- reciprocate but aren’t transactional
- consent to a little whimsy every while-or-so
