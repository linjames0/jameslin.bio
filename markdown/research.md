I spent the past month in the Boyden Lab at MIT. The lab has a history of inventing scientific tools, including but not limited to: [optogenetics](<https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1525)>), [temporal interference](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5520675/), [expansion microscopy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0219-4), and [temporal multiplexed imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423012278). Any of these tools on their own could make an argument for a Nobel — to have discovered and developed several is indicative of a systematic process, a sound approach to producing great science.

Apart from academic achievements, the lab has a history of spinning out companies working on [precision neuroimaging](https://e11.bio/), [AI for science](https://www.futurehouse.org/), and [wearable neurotechnologies](https://elemindtech.com/) to name a few. There is a deep understanding of what institutions are appropriate for the progress we hope to achieve.

I’m working on [nanoscale-imaging of C. elegans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35320565/) and in a future post I’ll do a deeper dive into my research. This post, however, is my attempt to distill observations on the *process* of doing great science from inside a world-class lab. This is not a guide to the 'publish or perish' flavor of science. I'm interested in how paradigms get torn down and rebuilt through the scientific method. There's magic here and it's working.

## How we get things done
It's worth noting that the Boyden Lab is atypical in some important ways:

#### 1. Flat hierarchy
Size does matter when you're running a 50-person lab. Most labs this large tend to bureaucratize but Ed has normalized a different kind of structure:

* Researchers have full agency over their own projects
* Anyone can email him directly anytime
* Lab members refer to him as just Ed

Through this flat structure, he facilitates highly efficient top-down decision-making and kills seniority politics. You don't need to go through a chain of authority to reach him. Even undergrads can propose and run their own experiments if the ideas are good. It's a highly merit-based culture.

#### 2. Go for gold
Our lab culture is a severe rejection of incrementalism. We want to innovate and redefine, not optimize p-values or benchmarks. Be damned if our research isn't at least Nobel-worthy.

Ed frequently questions the ambition of an idea: is it scalable? can we open-source the method for all labs? how does this fundamentally change how science gets done? He also constantly pushes for us to invert the premise: what if we didn't try to image smaller things? what if instead [we made them bigger](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0219-4)? Most of the time when you invert you arrive at something that sounds ridiculous, but on those rare occasions where the conclusion gives you a pause, you're on the cusp of revolution.

What struck me the most is that people (supposedly risk-averse academics!) join with the understanding they might not get *any papers* during their time at the lab. Many experiments fail and in big ways, but these are table stakes for great science. Some of our experiments end up working and they change the game.

With that out of the way, a lot of things remain true across different research labs.

## What to know about research
Or: advice on how to make the most of your time in lab.

#### 1. You get what you put in
* People are too busy to chase you
* Get to know everyone in the lab
    * Get context on what people are working on
    * People have already ran into the same problems and have thought about solutions
    * This also opens doors for potential collaborations
* Meetings aren't (totally) useless
    * Show up with something to contribute
    * The point is to build familiarity, reputation, and context
* Shadow people
    * Wet lab is rampant with tacit knowledge and you learn best by watching people actually run the experiments and then doing them yourself
    * In my first month I shadowed 6 postdocs, mostly to fill in for when my supervising postdoc was busy
        * I picked up wet lab skills and learned where various equipment was stationed
        * I also got a sense for the different ways people do things and their rationales e.g. how strict each person was with cleanliness, when to use plastic vs glass pipettes, when to use normal vs hydrophobic plates, how much light exposure a given sample could afford, etc.
* Exceed expectations
    * For my first check-in with Ed, I prepared slides on how I was doing the equivalent of a fairly smart MIT grad student, and quickly realized that the bar was much higher than just that. Complacency is not always bad but it is always a choice.
    
#### 2. Learning rate = feedback rate
* The single-most important factor for choosing a lab is the quality of mentorship
    * The research direction and everything else is secondary to ensuring you have a great supervisor or PI
    * My supervisor is the reason I chose the lab - he is fantastic at breaking down the science and can consistently explain down to Level 5 where most stop at Level 2
* Ask, ask, ask
    * The best researchers in the lab are the ones who are asking the most questions
    * Keep asking questions until you can deliver a killer lecture on the topic
    * Halting your line of questioning on Level 1 or 2 when you have *the* experts on the topic is a disservice to yourself
* Learn to learn from all criticism
    * Many people are bad at delivering feedback - focus on content and not delivery
    * There is always something to learn, even from (and especially from!) harsh or blunt feedback
* Set up regular check-ins with your PI or postdoc
    * Your PI has the context on what everyone in the lab is doing, what other groups have tried, what approaches worked and what didn't etc.
    * You might have an impulse to come up with 'your own' ideas but you don't have to reinvent the wheel - there's likely an easier (and more elegant) solution to your problem already out there if you ask

#### 3. Focus
* If you want to do great research, you cannot split your attention between projects
    * I initially wanted to work on two projects over the course of a few months, but Ed convinced me to focus on just one (1) project for 6 months
    * The time it takes to understand every angle of a scientific challenge is significant, and the hardest problems are soluble only through [undivided effort](https://jameslin.bio/focus)
    * I was forced to internalize longer timelines rather than jumping around collecting low-hanging fruit
* Often, people take on new projects after they encounter a tough roadblock when in reality that's when they should focus more

#### 4. Relationships rule the world
* Collaborations come out of who you know
    * Go to seminars, sign up for presentations, email people you’d like to work with
* Surround yourself with people who inspire you through their brilliance
* One of the best ways to 'network' in academia is to show deep interest in people's research
    * Genuine curiosity is hard to fake
    * Nothing lights up a postdoc's eyes more reliably than asking questions about the details of their obscure research
    * Asking good questions is hard though - it's important to do your own research and show up with serious inquiries
    * Receiving poorly thought-out questions is a filter for people - nobody wants to waste their time on someone who clearly doesn't care that much

Beyond the research process, there were some surprising things about academic culture I got to see firsthand.

## Academic culture
Academic labs are a fantastic place to learn, but not a great place to execute on commercial scientific projects. For that, you would need another kind of institution.

#### 1. Churn
Academia has a systemic talent problem. Most labs only have one professor-level person because the tenure system incentivizes great researchers to leave the lab to start their own group. Graduate students are only there for certification, and they leave for other positions after. Funding is low so research techs and undergrads jump at opportunities in industry for higher pay.

Because of this high level of churn, any given lab is often constrained by expertise. In industry, it's normal for people to stay at a single job for 10-20 years and in doing so they develop a deep domain expertise which is essential for hard technical breakthroughs.

#### 2. Competition
Given the rate of talent turnover, collaboration with other groups becomes all the more important. But here, too, there are incentive problems. It can be hard to initiate collaborations with labs in the same field because of the competitive politics  of publishing. Often, both groups are trying to publish first on similar discoveries. This causes a major conflict in authorship: who gets first author? second author? how do you split credit? which lab gets the patent? etc.

This is less of a problem *within* labs. Because people in our group are all working on their own differentiated projects, there's far less politics and competition. There's an open spirit of collaboration - we frequently share reagents, data, assist with teaching new techniques, send papers, and make introductions.


#### 3. Education
I think what's often overlooked about researcher-types is that they are great at teaching. They have TA'd for classes, given lectures, described their work to family and relatives, and they write all the time (papers, grant proposals) explaining science to a general audience. Everyone is capable of explaining their research in depth, sometimes down to the atom but usually at least down to the level of cells. For people aspiring to be sponges, academic researchers are your ocean.

But I've also been surprised how little people know outside of their own domains of expertise. Even at MIT, you can quickly become one of the lab experts on a relevant but niche area. Without exaggeration, I've met MD-PhDs who struggle with explaining basic chemistry and computational neuroscientists who don't know their way around a U-Net. It's striking to me because they would absolutely school me in their lane, but I've realized that my depth in several areas (CS, biology, neuroscience, physics) means that I usually have something to contribute to specialists.

And it's been equally startling the extent to which people are resistant to learning about new fields. You would expect neuroscientists to have a little more synaptic plasticity but their learning pathways calcify just like the rest. However, there are some who constantly absorb knowledge regardless of domain and these people stand out in a crowded field.

#### 4. Funding
Two things can be true at once - there is a lot of funding in academia, and funding is a constant constraint. Most small labs operate on $500k a year and for the larger ones annual funding can be upwards of $5M.

On its own, this is a large sum. But when you factor in the researchers ($50k-100k / person), reagents ($100-50k / bottle), and scientific equipment (~$50k-1M / unit), funding gets depleted rapidly by recurring costs. A single experiment can run upwards of $100k and cost weeks to months of researcher time.

What this feels like on the ground is a confusing contradiction. Many researchers spend weeks writing grant proposals. But there's also a lot of wasteful behavior. Because we deal with wildly out of proportion numbers all the time from nano up to giga, there's an insensitivity towards dollar amounts. We take extra care when experiments cost $50k, but $1k just isn't very much in comparison.

Our lab is large and for the most part we have access to state of the art equipment and reagents. We're also much more careful about preventing waste and minimizing administrative bloat. But because of our size we incur greater overhead than most labs. 

Earlier this year the BRAIN Initiative announced a [budget cut of nearly $300M](https://www.thetransmitter.org/funding/278-million-cut-in-brain-initiative-funding-leaves-neuroscientists-in-limbo/) for neuroscientific research, which was a major source of funding for neuroscience labs like ours. Along with the near-term risk of large cuts in government funding, money anxiety has been brought back to the forefront of academic concerns.

#### 5. Intensity
Having spent many years around SF startup founders, I was used to a high-intensity all-out-ness, something sorely missing from academic culture. I usually start lab-related stuff at 10am and I'm almost always the last to leave the lab around 10pm. I fill my days with papers and wet lab and chemistry. In contrast, most people usually get in around noon and leave early evening. In part this is because some people work from home, but there are two other culprits: there's no incentive for intensity and researchers emphasize work-life balance.

In most startups, your company is constantly under competitive pressure and threats of running out of money. If you don't stay in the office until 1am, some other team will and they will outcompete you. There isn't time to take your time.

The other thing is that most PhDs and postdocs are in their late 20s and early 30s, some of them have families and all of them have lives outside of lab. They're at a stage in life where work isn't so all-consuming, not to mention that academia is often chosen for its stability and certainty.

This is valid! Research isn't everything. I take some weekends off to make time for friends and road trips and personal interests. But the slower pace is something to keep in mind if you're thinking of doing research.

## Closing thoughts
The incentives of academic labs create a fantastic learning environment to pick up skills and experience, but the environment is not conducive to fast-paced execution of projects. That said, there are many slower-paced, longer-term scientific ambitions which are only possible in an academic setting. [The Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project) was a $3B effort to sequence the human genome with thin financial justification at the time, and yet a consortium of academic labs came together and made it happen. The scientific and medical community have since reaped the benefits of cheap, ubiquitous, scalable sequencing. 

Our lab is particularly concerned with mapping the human brain,referred to as the [Human Connectome Project](https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/human-connectome/connectome-programs), and developing the key neurotechnologies that come out of that research. It's unclear what the financial incentives are for such a project, but what we do know is that accomplishing such a feat will have great consequences for our understanding of the most complex organ known to man. If you're interested in supporting the effort in any way, shoot me an email @ [linjames@mit.edu](mailto:linjames@mit.edu). We're constantly looking to work with great scientists who can learn fast.

Having spent time in several academic labs, there is a great difference in the details of how things get done. As with everything, your mileage may vary. But hopefully, this gives you a good sense of what the process is like on the inside.
